1) This means that the branch was 'hit' (or processed) but that there are branches within that
not all possible paths of that branch have been reached (such as traveling down an if path but
not the else)

2) The interface is just a framework; there's no real code to work in interfaces because they 
simply provide the basic skeleton (parameters, function name and purpose, etc) but no actual
implementation.

3) It will only test the basic function; it won't test the interactions of numerous functions,
nor will it test the use of those functions in practice; it can simply test if that function
returns the correct values.

4) The more if/else statements the more branches there are, as each if/else is the creation of
two possible branches.
