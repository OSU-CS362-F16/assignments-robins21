Bug 3:

Title: Crash When Accessing Player Wallet
Product: Player.java
Classificatation: Crashing Bug
Platform: OSU Flip1, CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511
Can it be reproduced: Every time
Descrition: When accessing the Player Waller after calling on the nextHand() method of the Player 
class, the program crashes. This affects game functionality because the player should be able to
access their wallet during the next hand to determine how much can be placed in a bet. Instead,
they experience a game crash.

Failing Test Case:
    @Test
    public void testNextHandBeforeBet(){
        Player player1 = new Player();
        player1.nextHand();
        assertTrue(player1.currentBet == null || player1.getCurrentBet() == 0); //null may possible since currentBet starts there
        assertTrue(player1.currentInsurance == null || player1.makeInsuranceBet() == 0); //null may possible since currentInsurance starts there
        assertEquals((long)1000,(long)player1.currentWallet);
    }

In this test case, we should find that the Players current bet is null (or alternatively 0 would also
work). The wallet should remain at 1000, since the player did not make a bet to win or lose money
with. Instead the test has an error due to the wallet being null. This would cause a crash within
the game itself.

Correction to Player:

	Original:
		@Override
		public void nextHand() {
			currentBet = null;
			currentWallet = null;
			currentInsurance = null;
		}
	
	Correction:
	@Override
	public void nextHand() {
		currentBet = null;
		currentInsurance = null;
	}
	
Description: Removed line that was setting player wallet to null after nextHand() method called.
