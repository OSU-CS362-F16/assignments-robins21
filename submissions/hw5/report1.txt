Bug 1:

Title: Incorrect Number of Cards Being Dealth
Product: SimpleBlackjack.java
Classificatation: Serious
Platform: OSU Flip1, CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511
Can it be reproduced: Every time
Descrition: When running the SimpleBlackjack class playRound method, each player is being dealt an 
incorrect number of cards. This affects the functionality of the game because the game does not 
follow the rules of blackjack as currently implemented.

Failing Test Case:

    @Test
    public void testCorrectNumberOfCardsDealt(){
        DealerAction da = mock(DealerAction.class);
        PlayerAction pa1 = mock(PlayerAction.class);
        PlayerAction pa2 = mock(PlayerAction.class);

        PlayerAction[] players = {pa1,pa2};

        when(pa1.getAction()).thenReturn(PlayerAction.ActionType.STAND);
        when(pa2.getAction()).thenReturn(PlayerAction.ActionType.STAND);

        SimpleBlackjack j = new SimpleBlackjack(da,players);
        j.playRound();

        verify(da, times(2)).dealCard(pa1);
        verify(da, times(2)).dealCard(pa2);
        verify(da, times(2)).dealCard(da);
    }
	
In this test case, everyone is dealt the initial hand. All players choose to stand. Following rules 
of blackjack, each player and the dealer should then have two cards. That is not what we are seeing
in this test case.

Correction To SimpleBlackjack:

	Original:
		for(PlayerAction p: players ){
			dealer.dealCard(dealer);
			dealer.dealCard(p);
		}

	Correction:
		dealer.dealCard(dealer);
		dealer.dealCard(dealer);

		for(PlayerAction p: players ){
			dealer.dealCard(p);
			dealer.dealCard(p);
		}

	Description of Change: Changed SimpleBlackjack.java to deal two cards to dealer and then cycle
	through all players to deal each one two cards. Originally would cycle through all players and
	on each iteration deal one card to player and one card to dealer, resulting in dealing having
	one card for each player.
