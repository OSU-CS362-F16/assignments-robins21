1) Correction of bug in lastZero:
	public static int lastZero(int[] arr) {

		/*

		 * Returns the index of the last occurance of 0 or -1 if no such element

		 * exists
		 
		*/


		for (int i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {

			if (arr[i] == 0) {

				return i;

			}

		}

		return -1;

	}

2) Partition of lastZero Test Cases:
	Yes, it's possible to organize into partitions. The test cases I have are:

testLastZeroOneZeroEachCell: This tests the case of there being one zero in the array, testing each element for it.
(This was done to ensure the first, last and a middle element were all tested)

testLastZeroEmptyArray: This tests the condition of an array being passed that contains no elements

testLastZeroNoZeros: This test ensure that we receive correct results when there are no zeros in the array

testLastZeroMultipleZeros: This test goes through an array testing the case of having multiple zeros. It tests when
the first two elements are zeros up through all elements being zero. (This was done to ensure that cases of the first
and last elements being zero are checked, as well as a middle element, and all elements.

3) Advantage of Disjoint Test Cases:
	The advantage of having disjoint test cases is that it decreases the number of tests that are required while 
still allowing for tests to cover forseeable usage situations. For example, in the above only four tests were 
required to check on the entire range of possible inputs.
